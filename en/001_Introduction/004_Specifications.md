# Emercoin Specifications

Emercoin (EMC) is a
[cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) with
hybrid [PoS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake) and
[PoW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) mining
(merge-mined with Bitcoin). Coin generation is focused mostly on
production of coins by energy-conservative PoS as PoW difficulty
gradually increases over time.
