# EmcDPO
EmcDPO is a decentralized solution for the validation of [Digital Proof of
Ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_proof_of_ownership) (authenticity)
for both physical and digital goods and services, using the Emercoin blockchain. EmcDPO operates under the
**"dpo"** service abbreviation in the [Emercoin NVS](../Emercoin_NVS).

With pre-blockchain technology there exist a myriad of problems with the validation of
ownership in key areas of economic activity such as software licenses
and subscriptions, land titles and deeds, music, artwork, diamonds,
vehicle registrations and much more. The traditional methods used to
validate and authenticate ownership via written records and license keys
is burdensome, and opens up the possibility of fraud, counterfeiting and
even theft.

By outsourcing the factor of trust to the Emercoin blockchain, physical
and digital goods can now be assigned immutable proof of ownership to
their respective owners.

Digital Proof of Ownership solves many real world problems related to
the validation and authentication of products and services.
