# Proof-of-Stake block generation

By holding EMC in your wallet, you can assist the Emercoin network to
verify/broadcast transactions by generating new blocks with Emercoin's
[Proof-of-Stake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake) (PoS)
system.

When PoS blocks are generated, the wallet that generated the block is
rewarded with additional EMC. Earnings from PoS are at the rate of
approx. 6% per year. The process of generating blocks with Proof-of-Stake is loosely referred to as *minting*.

*EMC coin age maturity is 30 days. This means, the
[UTXO](https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/unspent-transaction-output) (Unspent Transaction Output) that
added the EMC to your balance must sit unspent for 30 days before it
becomes eligible to generate a PoS block.*

Proof-of-Stake guide
--------------------
This guide covers how to mint
[Proof-of-Stake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-stake) (PoS)
blocks with an encrypted wallet on your own computer using the <b>Emercoin
GUI</b>. Note that it is also possible to mint
PoS blocks on a headless server with the <b>Emercoin
daemon</b> (see *walletpassphrase* command
below).

Before we begin, let's understand a few things about PoS with Emercoin:

-   EMC blocks are mined approx. every 10 minutes.
-   The chance of mining a block with PoS is related to the amount of
    EMC you hold.
-   Coins must sit unspent in the EMC address for <u>30 days</u> to
    become eligible for staking.
-   Maximum staking weight (chances of staking) is reached after <u>90
    days</u>.
-   To have the chance to mine a block with PoS, the wallet must be
    unlocked for minting, as described below.
-   Staking correctly will generate approx. 6% interest p.a. The PoS
    reward for minting a block is based on coin age.

Follow these steps to mine PoS blocks using the GUI:

1. **Encrypt your wallet:**

    To encrypt your wallet, choose 'Encrypt Wallet' from the Settings menu
and choose a strong password that you won't forget.

    After your wallet is encrypted, a locked padlock icon appears at the
bottom of the window.

2. **Unlock your wallet in Mint-only mode:**

    Click the padlock icon at the bottom of the window, check the 'Mint only
mode' checkbox and enter your password.

    When the wallet is unlocked, the padlock icon at the bottom of the
window will appear unlocked.

    While the wallet is in 'Mint only mode', you can safely leave it open
without anyone being able to send funds out.

3. **Leave your wallet unlocked and running in Mint-only mode:**

    Coins only have a chance to stake while your wallet is open, and they
sit untouched in the EMC address for 30 days.

    If you mint a PoS block, you will see your 'Stake' balance change for 32
blocks until the PoS transaction confirms.

4. When coins have staked successfully, you will see new transaction and
new coins added to your balance.

### How often to run the client for staking?

You could unlock your wallet for minting for a few days each month,
however in practice it's unlikely all your transaction
[UTXO](https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/unspent-transaction-output)'s are
ready to stake at the same time. Therefore in the long term it is more
pratical to leave the wallet running 24/7 to increase your chances of
minting PoS blocks and to support the Emercoin network.

### Checking your PoS statistics

-   There is PoS calculator provided at
    <https://explorer.emercoin.com/poscal>.

-   Additional statistics particular to your EMC address are also
    available:

    -   Visit the Emercoin blockchain explorer at
        <https://explorer.emercoin.com> and search for your EMC address(es)
        that are currently staking.
    -   Run the staking calculator tool for your EMC address on <https://explorer.emercoin.com> (press the purple "leaf" icon and you will
        see the results on your minting %, coin age, and several other variables).

### Preventing your wallet from staking

While coins are staking they will not be accessible to spend. If you
need to prevent an amount of EMC from staking, simply set
**reservebalance** in your wallet's
[emercoin.conf](../Running_Emercoin/emercoin.conf) file. e.g:

    reservebalance=1000

To prevent your wallet from staking at all, simply set
**reservebalance** to be greater than your total EMC balance.

### Minting using the headless daemon

If using the command line daemon instead of the GUI then you can unlock
your wallet for minting using the
**walletpassphrase** command:

    walletpassphrase "passphrase" timeout [mintonly]

e.g. to unlock for minting for 604800 seconds (1 week):

    $ emc walletpassphrase yourlongrandompassphrase 604800 true

### Troubleshooting tips

-   Check your expected PoS rewards at
    <https://explorer.emercoin.com/poscal>
-   Check your minting statistics for your EMC address (see above).
-   Ensure the EMC
    [UTXO](https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/unspent-transaction-output)
    has been left unspent in your wallet for at least 30 days.
-   Ensure you have not set **reservebalance** in your wallet's
    [emercoin.conf](../Running_Emercoin/emercoin.conf) file.
