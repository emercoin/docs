General blockchain questions
============================

Q: What is a blockchain??
-------------------------

As:This is a kind of a database which is absolutely accurate and
identical for all the users who have donloaded and installed it.
Besides, you can not change any information in this base, only add some
new information. The confidence in the base is being the same for all
users and has not being changed backdating is called “trust” and this is
in fact the only advantage of a blockchain. The rest are disadvantages:
each user has to keep a copy of all (all, Karl!) the data ever added to
it; every new addition is required to be sent to all (millions of) the
users etc.

Q: What is the difference between a blockchain and a cloud database?
--------------------------------------------------------------------

**As:**That it is a cloud trusted database. That is you have a guaranted
way to make sure that all the users have the same information (that is
“trust”)

### Advantages of blockchain as a database:

1.  Trust – we are know exactly that all users have the same data
2.  The data have already been stored on the user’s computer, and does
    not have to be requested in the Internet every time. This allows to
    get tha data very quickly if necessary

### Disadvantages of blockchain as a database:

1.  You store not only your data, but the data of all the users. Too
    much storage capacity is reqiered
2.  All changes need to be transfered to all users. This
    1.  requires a lot of time
    2.  consumes a lot of traffic

3.  Your computer must verify the accuracy of all incoming data (there
    are some exceptions there). The worst case scenario in this matter
    for blockchains with smart contracts is that you need to verify not
    just the data, but to execute the whole program code; but
    theoretically the client can except data unthinkingly, though if all
    the clients are like that then blockcnain will collapse that is the
    load on processor is created
4.  To start using a blockchain, including the cases after a pause, you
    need to present all the whole information. It can last for hours and
    even days.

Q: We want to make our own blockchain which will be used only in our company
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Aj:** A private blockchain is like going to work by armoured vehicle –
not prohibited, but other decisions are more convenient, and advantages
offered by the technology is not required.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**As:** The main blockchain advantage (it is the only one, deep down) is
trust. The confidence of users in that they have simultaneous
information and that it can’t be backdated. The only way to prove that
they can trust your blockchain is to make as your blockchain supported
by numerous independent nodes. You must prove to all the users that you
won’t be able to change anything in the history, even if you want to.
For “internal” blockchain this requirement can’t be satisfied. If you
want to make such a blockchain, an ordinary database would most likely
sue, it will be much cheaper to use and more convenient.

Q: How much is it to make your own blockchain
---------------------------------------------

Aj: How much is it to make your own consulting company? As: You can make
a copy of blockchain software (wallet, server applications etc.) of
almost any cryptocurrency for a few thousands dollars (and authors often
ready to do it for you) However, this new blockchain won’t have the main
blockchain advantage - trust. So that any user will be sure the
blockchain is decentralized and the owner can’t change the information
voluntarily, he should know that the majority of supporting blockchain
miners (and in case of POS currency and coin holders) are independent.
Thus the next step of creating your own blockchain will be the
distribution of coins for POS to independent people and independent
miners’ involvement in POW curency. Besides, it will be required ВЫВЕСТИ
the cryptocurrency to the exchange and to create an information support.
For most of the cases it will cost about \$30 000 - 100 000 of
investments and withing 6-12 month period. Besides, as a result the
miners will have a part of the coins (in case of POS most of the money
must go to independent peoples otherwise the blockchain won’t have a
trust). Therefore it may be easier for a large investor to take an
available blockchain and buyout the major share of coins at the
exchange, it should be both quicklier and, perhaps, more profitable then
to create your own. And moreover there won’t be the risks of the project
not being successful.

Q: What is the smart contract?
------------------------------

As: This term was coined by Satoshi and initially appeared in scripts’s
descriptions of using different nonstandard variants of Bitcoin script
application. computers of the net However the great appearance of
Ethereum on the stage with Turing-compatible code in Blockchain actually
reformatted the initial definition and now the musses of people assume
by smart contracts as what Ethereum once used the term for which is free
code in Blockchain written in Turing-compatible language and running on
all of the. Then this term began being used by just about everyone and
often it turns out that different people assume absolutely different
things. Initially it was a program which could be run by every computer
of the net when receiving transactions and which can impact the result
of transactions processing. By the way, Bitcoin also has such a code but
its not fullturing, i.e. there can’t be written “whatever anyone likes”
written on it.

Questions on Emer
=================

Q: What is the difference between Emer and the other cryptocurrencies?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As: The main difference is the presence of NVS – the possibility of free
information storage in Blockchain records, as well as a number of
servises allowing to make solutions which use stored in NVS information.

Q: Why does Emercoin use Bitcoin’s core?
----------------------------------------

As: One of the Emer’s main priority is reliability. BItcoin code is the
most thoroughly studied one. Choosing from all possible core variants
(including the possibility of designing our own) Bitcoin core looks like
the best solution. can say that the core of our cryptocurrency has been
tested by time and thousands of enthusiasts, and we can prove it.

Q: Does Emer have smart contracts? If not, are there any plans to bring them in?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Aj:**Tell me, if you have a device on which your life depends (e.g.
cardio driver or just a computer managing your car),would you like
anyone who want it to be able to download any program code on it without
you knowing? Even if it is guaranted to you that the computer running
this code is high-performance enough and the software providing rights
differentiation between codes is tested well?

---

**As:**Emer infrastructure supports a number of menu function usually
associated with the smart contracts. Nevertheless, putting Turing-full
code and its forced running by all users in Blockchain is not planned
for the variety of reasons, the main of which is the factual
impossibility to prove the safety of such a Blockchain. There are at
least two potential problems: ОErrors in virtual machine (which is a
quite complex code) can lead to the compromising of the whole system.
The price of such a mistake is too high and we are not ready to expose
the entire system to such a risk. The errors in a specific smart
contract (when the virtual machine works correctly) may be dangerous for
specific realizations. Besides, we are concerned that Blockchain with
smart contracts will grow too fast and require too many resources to
support (because each application of each contract has to be fulfilled
by every user). Nevertheless, the above written information does not
emply the absence of other solutions of the tasks usually solved by
smart contracts. For more information you can read about it here

Q: Why don’t you create your new Emer Technology based Blockchain, move all resourses to support it and distribute money initially in proportion to the fiture investment into it’s development (провести ICO)?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aj: For the same reason that Apple’s (company’s) management do not leave
their job all at once for the purpose of founding a copy of the company
(called e.g. Pineapple) , to attract new investors and just continue
doing the business.

As: Apart undermining the trust for all team, the new Blockchain will
require in development. To make a fork of Emercoin, conclude a treaty
with exchanges, spread its coins will cost about \$100 000. However,
further on it will require its mimning to be provided (the outside
people will need to be motivated to install the wallet and use it and
can only be made by mining bonuses for). Coins will have be distributed
to those who will take part in the development. To regaining trust will
be the most difficult part, you will have to distribute the most part of
the coins. As a result you will get the same Emercoin, so why make if it
already exists?

Q: Who does Emer belongs to?
----------------------------

Aj: Who does the technology of solution of quadratics belong to?

As: All the technologies wich are the basis of the Emer blockchain, are
free software and have no owner. There are no patents for technology
used, moreover since they are in public property to issue such patents
is impossible. ВAll of these are great benefits because Emer’s users can
be sure that patents’s owners won’t stop the work of Emer and won’t
disrupt the way of their business.

Q: Who does Emercoin belong to?
-------------------------------

**Aj:** Who does gold belong to?

**As:** Emer can’t belong anyone specific. Decentralization is the
critically important feature of a reliable and confidential Blockchain.
You can imagine that Emer belongs to those who have coins, the coins
being a distant analog of the stocks (privileged). Unfortunately, I
don’t know who most part of the coins belong to. There are reasons to
believe that initiative group of Emer developers have a few millions of
coins (about 10-15% of all the amount but it is a suspition we ca only
suppouse. Another 10% may belong to the enthusiasts developing Emer on
locations. Besides, you may suppose on the ground of minting
transactions analizise that up to 30% of all coined money were lost. It
is difficult to imagine where the second part is, these coins might be
spread on many миноритарных investors’ (miners).

Q: Who manages the Emer project:
--------------------------------

**Aj:** Who is the sea director? Who is in charge of the sea traffic?

**As:**There is an initiative group which is developing Emer. EMW system
is used as the platform for work organization of this group
<http://wiki.emercoin.com/ru/index.php/EMW> . As in the previous
humorous example, Emer project can’t have a single power structure, just
as the sea carriers don't have a single power.The Blockchain in this
example is the sea itself, coins are the water; so the sea belongs to
everybody who owns the water. The fact that there is no single center of
Emer development does not mean that such centers can’t exist at all
though. There can be more than one of them as there can be more then one
company – sea carriers. For more details you can follow this link

Q: Which (blockchain) platform is the most advanced and has the amplest opportunities?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Aj:** Which flying vehicle is more adnaced and has the amplest
opportunities – a plane or a helicopter?

**As:** There is no direct answer for this question. Using different
blockchain technologies is optimal for different applications. When
developping Emer the first priority was the security and reliability of
Blockchain’s work, the second – widthness of capabilities. Therefore it
is worth using Emer in cases when its unique functions and sufficient
reliability are required, as well as a small Blockchain size.

Q: How do I start using Emer?
-----------------------------

As: The description is at the site Emercoin.com
<http://emercoin.com/getstarted>

Q: How do I buy Emercoin money?
-------------------------------

**As:** It depends on its amount and the time you are ready to spend
Smaller amounts (e.g. for buying a name inNVS) you can buy in exchanger.
[The list of available exchangers is at the Emercoin
site](http://emercoin.com/getstarted)

It is better to buy the lager amounts at the exchanges, it will be
cheaper, the list of exchanges is renewed at [the Emercoin
site](http://emercoin.com/getstarted) On the 3d July 2016 the three most
popular exchages are

1.  [Livecoin.net](http://www.livecoin.net/)
2.  [Chinese exchange btc38.com](http://www.btc38.com/)
3.  [биржа bittrex.com](https://bittrex.com/)

The purchase scheme for [Livecoin.net](http://www.livecoin.net/) is

1.  To find the most convenient way of introducing money to exchange
2.  To introduce the money by the chosen way
3.  To purchase the coins (they will appear on your account at
    the exchange)
4.  To transfer them to your wallet (you can keep them at the exchange
    if you want and if you trust it enough)

For the other two it is different

1.  To purchase Bitcoin money somewhere
2.  To transfer them to the chosen exchange
3.  To purchase the coins (they will appear on your account at
    the exchange) for bitcoin
4.  To transfer them to your wallet (you can keep them at the exchange
    if you want and if you trust it enough)

For operations with [Livecoin](http://www.livecoin.net/) you won’t be
needed to open any wallet first, I think this is the optimal way of
“quick enter” now (the begining of July 2016)

Sometimes big coins owners may carry out the off-exchange sells by prier
arrangment. **Beware the fraud!**

Q: How can I join to Emer the development or to projects on the Emer infrastructure network?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As: Emer is developing on the powers of decentralized non-commercial
community. The homepage page of community

The questions on the specific realization of technology
=======================================================

Q: Does Emer have technologies which are ready for usage at the moment?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As: technologies declared on the emercoin.com website can be used (and
are being used) at this moment. The ATOM technology is on the trial
stage at the moment (July (the) 2nd 2016) and doesn’t available yet.
