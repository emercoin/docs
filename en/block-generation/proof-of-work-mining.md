# Proof-of-Work block generation

Emercoin is now <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Merged_mining_specification">merge-mined</a> with
Bitcoin using the same SHA-256 <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system">Proof-of-Work</a> (PoW)
algorithm. Merge-mining enhances Emercoin's blockchain [security
model](/en/introduction/security-principles.md) as Emercoin can benefit from mining
power directed to the Bitcoin network. Any pool that mines Bitcoin can now also mine Emercoin as well, for little overhead.

-   Please ask your favorite <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://blockchain.info/pools">Bitcoin pool</a> to offer Emercoin merged-mining if they don't already.
-   To see which mining pools offer merged-mining, see this <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Comparison_of_mining_pools">comparison of mining pools</a> (check the merged-mining column).
-   It is also possible to merge-mine Emercoin in a completely decentralised way with <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://p2pool.org">p2pool</a>
